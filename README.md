# Workouts

A simple command line interface (CLI) for recording and viewing workouts.

The goal here is to provide a robust way of storing workout information over time with an easy-to-use interface for adding new workouts, removing workouts, progressing workouts, and viewing workouts.

## Install

Clone the repo, enter the base directory and run 'make'. The binary will be produced in bin/ (NOT /bin). The data file is in data/, which must currently sit in bin/../data (data/ must be in same dir as bin/). Alias to the bin/ directory and enjoy.


# Stuff to do
- Don't allow option to modify name when editing/progressing
- Autofill date when creating a new workout
- sorting options (last date, alphabetical, any others?)
- Add option to pipe input to program rather than only being able to use stdin
- load in workouts from a .csv program
