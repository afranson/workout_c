# Workouts

A simple, lightweight command line interface (CLI) for recording workouts.

The goal here is to have a simple, robust way of storing workout information over time with an easy-to-use interface for adding new workouts, removing workouts, progressing workouts, viewing workouts, etc.


# Stuff to do
- Don't allow option to modify name when editing/progressing
- sorting options (last date, alphabetical, any others?)
- Add option to pipe input to program rather than only being able to use stdin
- load in workouts from a .csv program
